                    <p class="lead">Software testing is a lengthy process with numerous steps. It is an important step
                        in
                        the software
                        development process that ensures only the best product reaches the end customer. Unit testing is
                        a
                        technique for evaluating programs and apps to check if they meet the requirements of their
                        users.

                    </p>
                    <p class="lead"> Individual components of a software program or application are tested as part of
                        the
                        unit testing
                        process. The primary goal is to ensure that all of the individual components are functioning
                        properly. The smallest software component that can be tested is known as a unit. It has a single
                        output and a few inputs in most cases.
                    </p>

                    <p class="lead"> The AAA pattern is a test structure pattern. It divides each test into three
                        sections:
                        Arrange, Act,
                        and Assert, each of which is a step toward the next. Each of them is only in charge of the
                        section
                        for which they were named.
                    </p>

                    <p class="lead"> So in the Arrange section, you just have the code needed to run that particular
                        test.
                        Objects would
                        be created here, mocks would be put up if used, and expectations might be defined. Then there's
                        the
                        Act, which is supposed to be the method's invocation. And on Assert, you'd just see if the
                        expectations had been met.
