                            <p> Pylint acts an assistant in helping user's write better code. It enforces a style guide
                                that
                                a user should follow when writing code and notifies the user when the style guide is not
                                followed by the user. It also notifies user when there is unnecessary code which does
                                not do
                                anything or has no particular use case.

                            <p> Now, we will see how to install and use pylint in your own code for Linux based systems.
                            </p>

                            <p> To install pylint, run the below command in your project terminal.</p>
                            <p class="at2"> pip install pylint </p>
                            <p>After installation is done, using pylint is as simple as running the below command in the
                                project terminal.</p>

                            <p class="at2"> pylint filename.py </p>
                            <p>Here filename is your own project file on which you would like to run the pylint. </p>

                                        details about the name, colors, size etc. Based on these descriptions, we can
                                        study
                                        about the parrot. Here, a parrot is an object. </p>

                                    <p>An object (instance) is an instantiation of a class. When class is defined, only
                                        the
                                        description for the object is defined. Therefore, no memory or storage is
                                        allocated. </p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                                    <h4>Namespace </h4>
                                    <p>A namespace in Python is a mapping of all the names you've defined to their
                                        related
                                        objects.


                                        At any given time, different namespaces can coexist, but they are totally
                                        segregated.


                                        When we start the Python interpreter, a namespace containing all of the built-in
                                        names is established and exists as long as the interpreter is running.


                                    </p>
                                    <p> This is why built-in functions like id(), print(), and others are always
                                        accessible
                                        from everywhere in the program. Each module generates a global namespace for
                                        itself.


                                        These several namespaces are separated. As a result, names that appear in
                                        several
                                        modules do not clash. </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Modules can have a number of different functions and classes.

                                        When a function is invoked, a local namespace is formed with all of the names
                                        defined in it. </p>

                                    <h4>Constructor </h4>
                                    <p>In object-oriented programming, a constructor is a particular method of a class
                                        or
                                        structure that initializes a newly formed object of that kind. The constructor
                                        is
                                        automatically invoked whenever an object is created. </p>
                                    <p> A constructor is similar to an instance method in that it can be used to set the
                                        values of an object's members to default or user-defined values. It normally has
                                        the
                                        same name as the class. A constructor, however, is not a legitimate method
                                        because
                                        it does not have a return type, despite its resemblance. The constructor
                                        initializes
                                        the object rather than performing a task by running code, and it cannot be
                                        static,
                                        final, abstract, or synchronized. </p>

                                <div id="Static Method">
                                    <h4>Static Method </h4>
                                    <p> Static methods are methods that are connected to a class rather than its object,
                                        similar to class methods.They do not involve the construction of a class
                                        instance.
                                        As a result, they are independent of the object's state. </p>
                                    <p> The following is the distinction between a static method and a class
                                        method: </p>
                                    <ol> The static method has no knowledge of the class and is just concerned with the
                                        parameters.
                                    </ol>
                                    <ol> The static method has no knowledge of the class and is just concerned with the
                                        parameters.
                                    </ol>

                                    <ol> Since the class method's parameter is always the class itself, it works with
                                        the
                                        class.
                                    </ol>

                                    <ol> Since the class method's parameter is always the class itself, it works with
                                        the
                                        class.
                                    </ol>
