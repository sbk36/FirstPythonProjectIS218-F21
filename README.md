# This repo contain code files for calculator that performs calculations on a webpage, using html, flask, nginx docker.
# Table functioanlity is added on this branch. User performed calculation are stored in csv and presented in the table.
# In the video you will be able to see that when caclulation is performed it is saved automatically in data.csv file, which is shown on right side of the screen.
# Than that data.csv file is used to populate the table in webpage. 
# Data validation and error handling is also implemented, for example on missing or invalid values the calculator will show error message and those logs are also saved in the table.
# Starting point of the program can be found below in app.py code
